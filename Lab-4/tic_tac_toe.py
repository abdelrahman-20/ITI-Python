"""
Task Description:
design and implement a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
The game should allow the player to choose whether to play with a friend (human vs human) or against the computer (human vs computer).

Requirements:

1. Core Classes:
   - Player
     - Attributes: name, symbol (X or O).
     - Methods: make_move(board).
   - HumanPlayer (inherits from Player)
     - Implements make_move() by asking the user for input.
   - ComputerPlayer (inherits from Player)
     - Implements make_move() by choosing a move automatically (random or simple strategy).
   - Board
     - Attributes: 3x3 grid.
     - Methods: display(), update(position, symbol), check_winner(), is_full().
   - Game
     - Attributes: players, board, current_turn.
     - Methods: play(), switch_turns().

2. OOP Concepts to Use:
   - Encapsulation: Keep the board grid private, only modify it using methods.
   - Inheritance: HumanPlayer and ComputerPlayer inherit from Player.
   - Polymorphism: make_move() behaves differently depending on the type of player.
   - Special Methods: Implement __str__() for board display formatting.

3. Game Flow:
   - The program starts by asking:
     Do you want to play with a friend (1) or vs computer (2)?
   - If option 1 ‚Üí two human players enter their names.
   - If option 2 ‚Üí one human player enters their name, and the opponent is the computer.
   - Players take turns placing X or O on the grid.
   - After each move, the board is displayed.
   - The game checks if a player has won or if the board is full (draw).
   - Print the winner or ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a draw!‚Äù at the end.

Deliverables:
- A single Python script (tic_tac_toe.py).
- The game must run from the terminal using:
  python tic_tac_toe.py
- Code should be clean, well-structured, and commented.
- Every student must attach Code and screenshots of the game in BOTH modes (one with a friend and one against the computer) and place them inside a lab4 folder.
